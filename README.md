# pytorch_challenge

The repository is forked form the Udacity Pytorch Challenge site. 

I was a participant in the inaugeral challenge of 2018/2019, and was successful in being accepted for the Facebook Scholarship that was awarded to 300 of the 10,000 participants in the challenge.

The notebook image_classifier_project was a template to develop our project, however I have develped my working solution in the other notebooks contained in this repo.
